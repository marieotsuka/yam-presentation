The third part of my practice is to develop scripts and algorithms for functional and poetic purposes. I will come back to what I mean by poetic computation.

Now that you all have a sense of the range of things I‚Äôm working on, I‚Äôm going to share a bit about my background of how I‚Äôve arrived in this particular intersection of practices. I‚Äôm calling these ‚Äúdetours,‚Äù because for me, it took a good amount of exploration to figure out how to channel my interests into a profession. I will be sharing a fair amount of my experience outside of design, but bare with me as I go through these, since I‚Äôll come back to design.

In the latter half of my talk, I‚Äôll describe a few of my projects in some more detail, where you could get the sense of how my experience in these detours informed my point of view and way of working as a designer.

## Phase 1
### *putting learning to work*

I grew up always engaged in the arts, drawing, painting, and digital illustrations. I made my first website in middle school to host some fan art I had made (which I‚Äôm too embarassed to show right now.) I made of posters and album art for my friends‚Äô bands in highschool. 
I did this by, basically, Googling. I went down all the rabbit holes and tutorials to teach myself coding, and learn how to use Adobe software. 

--
.centered.appear[![MS Paint](img/ms-paint.png)]

???

In the beginning, all I had for a digital art-making tool was something called Microsoft Paint. I remember trying to mimic anti-aliasing, the process of blurring pixels to render a smooth edge, by individually figuring out blended colors, one pixel at a time.

But at that point, I didn‚Äôt necessarily know I wanted to be a designer. To be honest, I did not know anyone who worked as a designer, and I couldn‚Äôt visualize what that might look like as a career. But this intese period of self-study really equipped me with the technical skills that would come in handy later in my life.

## Intersdisciplinary Studies

  <div class="circle">
    Sociology
  </div>
</div>

???

Not knowing exactly what I would want to study, I chose attending a liberal arts college, at University of Chicago ‚Äî and ended up studying a little bit of everything. In particular, I was drawn to classes in visual art, art history, philosophy and sociology.

I ended up creating my own major focused on "Aesthetics," or the philosophy of art, under Interdisciplinary Studies in Humanities. Specifically, my focus was on metaphorical understanding ‚Äî how the difference between literal and figurative meaning work to achieve deeper levels of communication.

What I didn‚Äôt realize was that these theories, in practice, was graphic design. 

---

### Designing on the side

???
But I did take on a student job working for the College to help produce materials for the school, and I was involved in many of the student organizations, which tended to involve the need for things like posters to advertise for the events. Learning on the job, or figuring things out for specific projects was a key way for me to practice and develop my design skills. This must be something you all at YAM are very familiar with!

While I enjoyed working on these projects, as I approached college graduation, I was leaned towards getting a standard "job" that will "pay the bills." I took the first offer I got, which is definitely something I don‚Äôt recommend. But this job in IT consulting was a way for me to learn how "work works" in a general sense, almost like getting a liberal arts degree in business and technology. I travelled 4 days a week, every week, for almost three years, supporting various projects at a range of clients: this helped me understand how organizations are structured, and get a glimpse of the wide variety of jobs that are available out there. 

All of the fancy consulting jargon that surrounded this work actually pointed to basic, matter-of-fact aspects of work. You want to make sure people know what they need to do, and have the right tools and process to do it in way that works for their own teams at a micro scale, as well as for the business at a macro scale.

My biggest takeaway from this work was really the necessity of people mediating our relationship with technology ‚Äî with the rigidity and bias of our tools. A big part of my job at this time was going back-and-forth between the developers who actually program the software, the business people who define the overarching motivations for this tool, and the actual people (end-users) who will be using this software for their work on a day-to-day basis, and translating the language and intentions between these groups.

Throughout all of this, though, I was taking on side projects here and there as a freelance designer. This work often came by through word-of-mouth; friends of friends needed a logo, illustration, or website, etc. Because these design and coding skills were something I taught myself, I wasn‚Äôt sure how viable they will be as a professional ‚Äî but I decided I‚Äôll give it a shot. I applied for an in-house designer / developer position at a non-profit called the United Nations Global Compact, and worked there for about a year. 

---

### United Nations Global Compact

???

As I worked for the UN Global Compact, which was the corporate sustainability branch of the United nations, I gained experience in creating design materials for mission-driven communciations purposes. This often required designing across different platforms, from desktop to mobile to printed paper to banner ads, even maybe a Times Square billboard. 

However, the more I worked, the more I craved a rigorous education in design. This is when I decided to apply to Art School.

## Phase 3
### *designing as a way of thinking*

---

### Rhode Island School of Design

???

I received some questions about portfolios, and the benefits of going to a school like RISD. I‚Äôm not involved in admissions, so take what I say with a grain of salt. 

just keep making what drives you. Be prepared to experiment. Even if you are interested in graphic design, don‚Äôt be afraid of including work that you are excited about. I had wide range from paintings and figure drawings to data visualizations in my portfolio. 

Especially for undergraduate studies, you don‚Äôt declare a major until your second year. So your choice of medium matters less than your level of engagement with your work. 

---

### Your smart friends

???

You will go through an extermely rigorous training in expressing ideas through form. Why go to school if you  But I feel 

---
class: center, middle

### make, make, make

???

One thing that is true at RISD, whether at the undergraduate or graduate level, is that you will be pushed to make. The philosophy of the school is thinking through making: you must be ready to express ideas through a creative act, in the broadest sense of the word, and do it many, many times in many different ways.

# Web Type

???

- I‚Äôve been teaching at RISD for five years, but last year I created a new elective called Web Type.


---

## Sustainability and Design


???

Lately, I‚Äôve been interested in our roles as designers amidst impending impacts of climate change.

---

### Low-tech Magazine

???

This was a project I began with [Lauren Traugott-Campbell](https://squishysystems.com/)


---

## *Design is a verb, not a noun*

???


---

## *Tools are embedded with points of view*

???

I like to either create my own tool, or use tools that give me closer access to the raw material. 


---

# *Context = Content*


???

- what actions are you encouraging through your design?
physical context
semantic context
temporal context


---

## How it all fits

- Drawing ‚Äî‚Äî type design
- Websites ‚Äî‚Äî web and software developer
- Information technology + consulting ‚Äî‚Äî teaching
- UN, climate change ‚Äî‚Äî digital sustainability

???

I‚Äôm not a career advice expert. But I hope that hearing about my trajectory, which may be a bit of an atypical segway into design, was still useful for understanding that your interests tend to inform one another, and that intersection tends to craft a unique path. Listen to what excites you, what makes you curious ‚Äî and pursue them to the best of your ability, while also embracing your ability to change.
