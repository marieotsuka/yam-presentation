# Hi!

???

Hi! My name is Marie Otsuka. Thanks to Brook and Joanna to invite me to speak today, and thank you all for joining! Please feel free to ping me in the chat with any questions through out my talk.

---

## *How do I become a graphic designer?*

???
I don‚Äôt know the answer to this, but what I can do is share how I became a graphic designer. Bear in mind that my trajectory is a bit atypical.

---

## A point of view

???
What I do have is a point of view about interesting design. I‚Äôm just going to skim through and list these first, how I arrived at these principles, and hopefully as I go through my talk, you can undertand how I arrived at these principles. 

--

### *Design is a verb, not a noun*

--

### *Tools are embedded with assumptions*

--

### *Context = Content*

---

    <em>select detours</em>
  </div>
  <div class="col">
    <h2></h2>
    <em></em>
  </div>
</div>


???

I‚Äôm calling these ‚Äúdetours,‚Äù because for me, it took a good amount of exploration to figure out how to channel my interests into a profession.

In the latter half of my talk, I‚Äôll describe a current work, where you could get the sense of how my experience in these detours informed my point of view and way of working as a designer.

## Phase 1
### *self-driven learning*

---

<div id="search" class="illo">
<span id="searchbar"></span>
</div>

???

I grew up always engaged in the arts, drawing, painting, and digital illustrations. I made my first website in middle school to host some fan art I had made (which I‚Äôm too embarassed to show right now.) I made of posters and album art for my friends‚Äô bands in highschool. 
I did this by, basically, Googling. I went down all the rabbit holes and tutorials to teach myself coding, and learn how to use Adobe software. 

--
.centered[![MS Paint](img/ms-paint.png)]

???

In the beginning, all I had for a digital art-making tool was something called Microsoft Paint.

.zoomimage[![antialias](img/antialias.png)]
.caption[Anti-aliasing. Source: [wikimedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Anti-aliasing_demo.svg)]
</figure>

???
I remember trying to mimic anti-aliasing, the process of blurring pixels to render a smooth edge, by individually figuring out blended colors, one pixel at a time.

But at that point, I didn‚Äôt necessarily know I wanted to be a designer. To be honest, I did not know anyone who worked as a designer, and I couldn‚Äôt visualize what that might look like as a career. But this intese period of self-study really equipped me with the technical skills that would come in handy later in my life.

???

Not knowing exactly what I would want to study, I chose attending a liberal arts college, at University of Chicago ‚Äî and ended up studying a little bit of everything. In particular, I was drawn to classes in visual art, art history, philosophy and sociology.

I ended up creating my own major focused on "Aesthetics," or the philosophy of art, under Interdisciplinary Studies in Humanities. Specifically, my focus was on metaphorical understanding ‚Äî how the difference between literal and figurative meaning work to achieve deeper levels of communication.

???

- technology sucks
- mediation is necesssary, both for using tech but also for translating between different groups
- as a designer, you‚Äôre synthesizing ideas from different parties

---

## Career Change

???

Throughout all of this, though, I was taking on side projects here and there as a freelance designer. This work often came by through word-of-mouth; friends of friends needed a logo, illustration, or website, etc. Because these design and coding skills were something I taught myself, I wasn‚Äôt sure how viable they will be as a professional ‚Äî but I decided I‚Äôll give it a shot. I applied for an in-house designer / developer position at a non-profit called the United Nations Global Compact, and worked there for about a year. 

---

### United Nations Global Compact

<figure class="centered" markdown="1">
.img[![UNGC](img/ungc.gif)]
.caption[UN Global Compact collateral]
</figure>

???

As I worked for the UN Global Compact, which was the corporate sustainability branch of the United Nations, I gained experience in creating design materials for mission-driven communciations purposes. This often required designing across different platforms, from desktop to mobile to printed paper to banner ads, even maybe a Times Square billboard. 

However, the more I worked, the more I craved a rigorous education in design. This is when I decided to apply to art school.

## Phase 3
### *designing as a way of thinking*

---

### Thinking through making


???

To be honest, I did not know what to expect from RISD. Rhode Island School of Design ‚Äî What you can expect is an extermely rigorous training in expressing ideas through form.

--
#### *Visual form as expressions of ideas*


???
You must be ready to express ideas through a creative act, and be willing to do it many, many times in many different ways.


---

### Experimentation

#### * Challenge received ideas *

### Low-tech Magazine
- studies historical and obsolete technologies
- researches the social and environmental problems that result from the use of high technology
- combines old techniques to create low-tech solutions

???

LTM is an on-line journal that casts doubts on progress and technology since 2007. The magazine was founded by **Kris de Decker** who remains the main author. 

---


### What is a low-tech website?

???

This was a project I began with [Lauren Traugott-Campbell](https://squishysystems.com/) in graduate school, and continued on with my collaborators Roel Roscam Abbing and Kris De Decker. It‚Äôs still a work-in-progress.

### Compressed images

???

- Must have low data footprint for the low-power machine to support
- Reduce size of media
- Automatic conversion was necessary due to the amount of existing article images

- Reveal that the browser is an active agent in what you see ("User agent")
- Browser is part of the infrastructure

---

### Minimize assets loaded

???

- In addition to reducing the media load, minimize the # of HTTP Requests

--
- Inline SVGs, Image Sprites

.wide[![sample image sprite](img/ltm/image-sprite.png)]

--

- No ads

???
- Other strategies: subsetting fonts
- loading a single variable font
- CSS vs. JS animations, CSS properties are suited for animations

---
###  Accessibility

???
- There are added benefits to these moves: it improves the accessibility of the site

--

- Support for older browsers

???

--
- Support for slower internet connections

???

---
## Infrastructure ‚Üí Design

???
- The design of the site needed to communicate the way it works, and the way it was made
- Friction in user experience needed to be explained

---

![screenshot of battery](img/ltm/battery.png)

.footnote[Battery meter, weather forecast, page weight indicator]

--

???
- Battery level of server powering the website
- Goes up when battery chargin
- Goes down when visitors access site
- Battery meter communicates the relationship of supply and demand of energy

---

### Design Goals
- Reveal that the internet is not immaterial
- Encourage visitors to consider their digital energy use consumption
- Challenge the expectation of 100% uptime

.footnote[Read more [about the site](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/about.html
)]

???
- Determine low-tech approach tailored to the site‚Äôs specific conditions
- Reveal the infrastructure behind websites and the materiality of digital assets
- Use the least amount of energy as possible
- Challenge the notion of 100% uptime

---
class: section

## Foundational principles

---

## *Design is a verb, not a noun*

???
- process
- *Technique over technology*
- technique is about how things are used, embedded or contextualized

---

## *Tools are embedded with assumptions*

???
- squarespace
- I like to either create my own tool, or use tools that give me closer access to the raw material. More and more, these intentions and biases of tools are becoming more obscured, and we are often unkowingly carrying out a corporate agenda. 

---

## *Context = Content*

???

- what actions are you encouraging through your design?
- physical context,  semantic context, temporal context
- What kind of behavior are you encouraging with your design?

---

I‚Äôm not a career advice expert. But I hope that hearing about my trajectory, which may be a bit of an atypical segway into design, was still useful for understanding that your interests tend to inform one another, and that intersection tends to craft a unique approach. Listen to what excites you, what makes you curious ‚Äî and pursue them to the best of your ability, and giver yourself license to change your mind.

# Q & A

???
-  I received some questions about portfolios, and the benefits of going to a school like RISD. I‚Äôm not involved in admissions, so take what I say with a grain of salt. 

- just keep making what drives you. Be prepared to experiment. Even if you are interested in graphic design, don‚Äôt be afraid of including work that you are excited about. I had wide range from paintings and figure drawings to data visualizations in my portfolio. 

- Especially for undergraduate studies, you don‚Äôt declare a major until your second year. So your choice of medium matters less than your level of engagement with your work.
