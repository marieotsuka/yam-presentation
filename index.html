The third part of my practice is to develop scripts and algorithms for functional and poetic purposes. I will come back to what I mean by poetic computation.

Now that you all have a sense of the range of things I‚Äôm working on, I‚Äôm going to share a bit about my background of how I‚Äôve arrived in this particular intersection of practices. I‚Äôm calling these ‚Äúdetours,‚Äù because for me, it took a good amount of exploration to figure out how to channel my interests into a profession. I will be sharing a fair amount of my experience outside of design, but bear with me.

## Phase 1
### *putting learning to work*

---

<div id="search" class="illo">
<span id="searchbar"></span>
</div>

???

I grew up always engaged in the arts, drawing, painting, and digital illustrations. I made my first website in middle school to host some fan art I had made (which I‚Äôm too embarassed to show right now.) I made of posters and album art for my friends‚Äô bands in highschool. 
I did this by, basically, Googling. I went down all the rabbit holes and tutorials to teach myself coding, and learn how to use Adobe software. 

--
.centered[![MS Paint](img/ms-paint.png)]

???

In the beginning, all I had for a digital art-making tool was something called Microsoft Paint. I remember trying to mimic anti-aliasing, the process of blurring pixels to render a smooth edge, by individually figuring out blended colors, one pixel at a time.

--
<figure class="centered" markdown="1" style="background: #ffffff;">

.caption[Anti-aliasing. Source: [wikimedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Anti-aliasing_demo.svg)]
</figure>

???

But at that point, I didn‚Äôt necessarily know I wanted to be a designer. To be honest, I did not know anyone who worked as a designer, and I couldn‚Äôt visualize what that might look like as a career. But this intese period of self-study really equipped me with the technical skills that would come in handy later in my life.

Not knowing exactly what I would want to study, I chose attending a liberal arts college, at University of Chicago ‚Äî and ended up studying a little bit of everything. In particular, I was drawn to classes in visual art, art history, philosophy and sociology.

I ended up creating my own major focused on "Aesthetics," or the philosophy of art, under Interdisciplinary Studies in Humanities. Specifically, my focus was on metaphorical understanding ‚Äî how the difference between literal and figurative meaning work to achieve deeper levels of communication.

I was involved in many of the student organizations, which tended to involve the need for things like posters to advertise for the events. This must be something you all at YAM are very familiar with!

While I enjoyed working on these projects, my instinct was to still get a standard "job" that will "pay the bills." I took the first offer I got, which is definitely something I don‚Äôt recommend. But this job in IT consulting was a way for me to learn how "work works" in a general sense, almost like getting a liberal arts degree in business and technology. I travelled 4 days a week, every week, for almost three years, supporting various projects at a range of clients: this helped me understand how organizations are structured, and get a glimpse of the wide variety of jobs that are available out there. 

All of the fancy consulting jargon that surrounded this work actually pointed to basic, matter-of-fact aspects of work. You want to make sure people know what they need to do, and have the right tools and process to do it in way that works for their own teams at a micro scale, as well as for the business at a macro scale.

My biggest takeaway from this work was really the necessity of people mediating our relationship with technology ‚Äî with the rigidity and bias of our tools. A big part of my job at this time was going back-and-forth between the developers who actually program the software, the business people who define the overarching motivations for this tool, and the actual people (end-users) who will be using this software for their work on a day-to-day basis, and translating the language and intentions between these groups. 

---

## Career Change

???

Throughout all of this, though, I was taking on side projects here and there as a freelance designer. This work often came by through word-of-mouth; friends of friends needed a logo, illustration, or website, etc. Because these design and coding skills were something I taught myself, I wasn‚Äôt sure how viable they will be as a professional ‚Äî but I decided I‚Äôll give it a shot. I applied for an in-house designer / developer position at a non-profit called the United Nations Global Compact, and worked there for about a year.

As I worked for the UN Global Compact, which was the corporate sustainability branch of the United Nations, I gained experience in creating design materials for mission-driven communciations purposes. This often required designing across different platforms, from desktop to mobile to printed paper to banner ads, even maybe a Times Square billboard. 

However, the more I worked, the more I craved a rigorous education in design. This is when I decided to apply to Art School.

## Phase 3
### *designing as a way of thinking*

### Art School

To be honest, I did not know what to expect from RISD. Rhode Island School of Design ‚Äî What you can expect is an extermely rigorous training in expressing ideas through form.

---

### Thinking through making

#### *Visual form as expressions of ideas*


???
You must be ready to express ideas through a creative act, and be willing to do it many, many times in many different ways.

### Low-tech Magazine
- studies historical and obsolete technologies
- researches the social and environmental problems that result from the use of high technology
- combines techniques of yesterday with knowledge of today to create low-tech solutions

LTM is an on-line journal that casts doubts on progress and technology since 2007. The magazine was founded by **Kris de Decker** who remains the main author.

# What is a low-tech website?

## Foundational principles

---

## *Design is a verb, not a noun*

---

## *Technique over technology*

???
- technique is about how things are used, embedded or contextualized

---

## *Tools are embedded with points of view*

---

## *Context = Content*


???

I like to either create my own tool, or use tools that give me closer access to the raw material. More and more, these intentions and biases of tools are becoming more obscured, and we are often unkowingly carrying out a corporate agenda. 

- what actions are you encouraging through your design?
physical context
semantic context
temporal context
- What kind of behavior are you encouraging with your design?

I‚Äôm not a career advice expert. But I hope that hearing about my trajectory, which may be a bit of an atypical segway into design, was still useful for understanding that your interests tend to inform one another, and that intersection tends to craft a unique path. Listen to what excites you, what makes you curious ‚Äî and pursue them to the best of your ability, and giver yourself license to change your mind.

# Q & A

???
-  I received some questions about portfolios, and the benefits of going to a school like RISD. I‚Äôm not involved in admissions, so take what I say with a grain of salt. 

- just keep making what drives you. Be prepared to experiment. Even if you are interested in graphic design, don‚Äôt be afraid of including work that you are excited about. I had wide range from paintings and figure drawings to data visualizations in my portfolio. 

- Especially for undergraduate studies, you don‚Äôt declare a major until your second year. So your choice of medium matters less than your level of engagement with your work.
