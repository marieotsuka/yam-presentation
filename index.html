# § 1. Detours

???

I’ll first begin by sharing a little bit about my background. For me, it took me some detours to figure out what it means to be designer. 

---
class: middle

## Detour 1: academics 

---


XXXX

???

I grew up always engaged in the arts, drawing, painting, and digital illustrations. I made my first website in middle school to host some fan art I had made (which I’m too embarassed to show right now.) I made of posters and album art for my friends’ bands in highschool. 
I did this by, basically, Googling. I went down all the rabbit holes and tutorials to teach myself coding, and learn how to use Adobe software. 

But at that point, I didn’t necessarily know I wanted to be a designer. To be honest, I did not know anyone who worked as a designer, and I couldn’t visualize what that might look like as a career. But this intese period of self-study really equipped me with the technical skills that would come in handy later in my life.

???

As I was graduating highschool and entering college, I didn’t necessarily have a clear idea of what I wanted to do. I ended up attending a liberal arts college, at University of Chicago, not to study anything in particular, but to equip myself with a general skillset to think and write critically.

In college, I was interested in the intersection of different disciplines, and ended up creating my own major focused on "Aesthetics," or the philosophy of art, under Interdisciplinary Studies in Humanities. Specifically, my focus was on metaphorical understanding — how we could say one thing and mean another; the difference between literal and figurative meaning.

---

## Phase 2, Detour: Work

<div id="work">

</div>

???

And even though I was excited by the theories cultivated in college, unfortunately it still did not provide me with a clear path for work. I took a job in IT consulting, which was I felt was a way for me to learn how "work works" in a general sense, almost like getting a liberal arts degree in business and technology. I travelled 4 days a week, every week, for almost three years, supporting various projects at a range of clients: this helped me understand how organizations are structured, and get a glimpse of the wide variety of jobs that are available out there. 

My biggest takeaway from this work was really the necessity of people mediating our relationship with technology — with the rigidity and bias of our tools. For example, a global company with headquarters in the U.S. is deploying a software that helps produce invoices, but needs to accommodate for certain needs in Japan; if the technology can’t handle special scenarios, then we need to work out some workaround for the Japanese users to still be able to use the system. A big part of my job at this time was going back-and-forth between the developers who actually program the software, the business people who define the overarching motivations for this tool, and the actual people (end-users) who will be using this software for their work on a day-to-day basis.

---

## Phase 3, Decision: Design



???

Throughout all of this, though, I was taking on side projects here and there as a freelance designer. This work often came by through word-of-mouth; friends of friends needed a logo, illustration, or website, etc. Because these design and coding skills were something I taught myself, I wasn’t sure how viable they will be as a professional — but I decided I’ll give it a shot. I applied for an in-house designer position at a non-profit, and worked there for about a year.

### United Nations Global Compact


???

So as I worked for the UN Global Compact, the corporate sustainability branch of the United nations, I gained experience in creating design materials for communciations purposes. This is an example of the Carbon Pricing initiative. However, the more I worked, the more I craved a rigorous education in design. This is when I decided to apply to Art School.

### Rhode Island School of Design

???

I received some questions about portfolios, and the benefits of going to a school like RISD. I’m not involved in admissions, so take what I say with a grain of salt. 

But and just keep making what drives you. Experiment — with diffent tools, different subjects, different. Even if you are interested in graphic design, don’t be afraid of including work that you are excited about. I had wide range from paintings and figure drawings to data visualizations in my portfolio. 

Especially for undergraduate studies, you don’t declare a major until your second year. So your choice of medium matters less than your level of engagement with your work. 

---

### Benefits

???

You will go through an extermely rigorous training in expressing ideas through form. Why go to school if you  But I feel

### make, make, make

???

One thing that is true at RISD, whether at the undergraduate or graduate level, is that you will be pushed to make. The philosophy of the school is thinking through making: you must be ready to express ideas through a creative act, in the broadest sense of the word, and do it many, many times in many different ways.

## Sustainability and Design

Lately, I’ve been interested in our roles as designers amidst impending impacts of climate change.

### Low-tech Magazine

This was a project I began with [Lauren Traugott-Campbell](https://squishysystems.com/)

## *Tools are embedded with points of view*

I like to either create my own tool, or use tools that give me closer access to the raw material.

# *Context = Content*


???

- what actions are you encouraging through your design?
physical context
semantic context
temporal context


---

## How it all fits

- Drawing —— type design
- Websites —— web and software developer
- Information technology + consulting —— teaching
- UN, climate change —— digital sustainability

???

I’m not a career advice expert. But I hope that hearing about my trajectory, which may be a bit of an atypical segway into design, was still useful for understanding that your interests tend to inform one another, and that intersection tends to craft a unique path. Listen to what excites you, what makes you curious — and pursue them to the best of your ability, while also embracing your ability to change.
